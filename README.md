## What I am currently working on :
- ~~trying to implement cascase style controller for this driver~~ 
- ~~i2c communication~~
- self diagnostic 
- RS485 comms
- implementing temperature sensors
- redesign of board (Encoder on board , temperature sensors,and daisy chain ability)


## Done :
- PID velocity and position control 
- precise position hold under load 
- Gravity compensation mode
